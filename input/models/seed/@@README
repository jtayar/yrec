 Polytrope starting models were fragile, in that if perturbed/rescaled 
 they frequently failed to converge.
 
 However, if they were rescaled and a few (3 to 7) timesteps were 
 taken, the resulting models seemed much more robust.
 
 Because we have a dense grid of polytrope starting models, new 
 starting models with desired parameters could be created in a few 
 rescaling steps.
