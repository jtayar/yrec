   FIXTABLE for Nextgen2 Tables
                        LLP  10/02/08

FIXTABLE accepts 'Nextgen2.raw' as input, validates the 
file, including filling in "holes" in the interior of the 
file, and writes the updated (Still unsorted) 'Nextgen2.all'
file as output.

Two "holes" were found and fixed by linear interpolation in 
TeffL. These were at TEFFL=2000, GL=5.0, and TEFFL=8800,GL=5.0.
