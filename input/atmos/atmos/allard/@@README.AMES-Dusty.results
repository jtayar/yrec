   FIXTABLE for AMES-DUSTY2
                        LLP  10/02/08

FIXTABLE accepts 'AMES-Dusty2.raw' as input, validates the 
file, including filling in "holes" in the interior of the 
file, and writes the updated (Still unsorted) 'AMES-Dusty2.all'
file as output.

In this case the only usaable part of the table was for 
Fe/H = 0, so the output file has been aliased 'AMES-Dusty2.p00'

Only one "hole" was found and fixed by linear interpolation in 
TeffL. This was at TEFFL=1900, GL=5.5
