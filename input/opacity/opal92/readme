Notes:
-----2/3/94       Replaced XCOTRIN.f, COTRIN.f, and XZTRIN.f with revised
                  versions.  Should not effect previous calculations.
-----12/16/93     Added file G93highz.  Tables for new Grevesse and
                  Noels Photospheric abundances (Sept. 1993).
                  Only small differences with G91highz are obtained (1-2%).
                  In order to use XZTRIN.f interpolation code you need to
                  change OPEN (2,FILE='G91highz') to OPEN(2,FILE='G93highz')
-----7/25/93      Cosmetic changes to XZTRIN.f and XCOTRIN.f
-----7/22/93      Replaced the file G91x70z03. 
                  This file actually contained the same data as
                  G91x70z02.  This error would have been detected by
                  the XCOTRIN.f and COTRIN.f codes, which check for
                  consistency of Z.
-----7/22/93      Replaced XCOTRIN.f, COTRIN.f, and XZTRIN.f.
                  Fixed some problems with going out of tables.
-----7/13/93      Replaced XCOTRIN.f and COTRIN.f with improved versions.
                  Also replaced XTRIN.f with XZTRIN.f. The codes
                  XCOTRIN.f, COTRIN.f, and XZTRIN.f all now carryout a
                  least squares based adjustment of the tabulated data,
                  prior to interpolation.  The code XZTRIN.f (supplants
                  XTRIN.f) interpolates the G91highz (PopI) opacity
                  tables.  Use a call to OPACG91 to interpolate in
                  X,Z,T6, and R.  Use a call to OPAC to interpolate
                  in X,T6, and R at tabulated values of Z ( see code
                  for explicit values).
-----5/7/93       Made corrections to XCOTRIN.f and COTRIN.f to correct
                  problems with derivatives and points outside of table.
                  Also added SAVE statements required for some compilers
-----2/25/93      Added lines 633-634 to XCOTRIN.f to avoid error that 
                  occurs when the initial x > 0.07.
                           633      alt(51)=log10(200.)
                           634      alt(52)=lof10(500.)
-----12/17/92     Made  dXc+dXo=0 a special case> Destroy earlier versions
                    of XCOTRIN.f and COTRIN.f 
-----12/17/92     Modified XCOTRIN.f and COTRIN.f> Destroy earlier versions
-----12/16/92     Modified XCOTRIN.f and COTRIN.f> Destroy earlier versions

-----12/14/92     Replaced the file G91x70z001-removed extraneous
                            data.  Added some necessary blank lines to
                            the end of some of the G91x*z* files.  Added
                            additional G91x*z* files for Z=0.004 , 0.01,
                            and 0.003

------------DESCRIPTION OF ENHANCED C AND O TABLES-----------

	This directory contains extensive opacity tables and codes for 
interpolation of these tables in C, O, T6, and LogR or in X, C, O, T6,
and LogR.  These codes provide the opacity and smooth first derivatives
of the opacity.

	The complete set of enhanced C/O tables is currently comprised
of 30 files organized as follows:

Z=0 set: 

	G91x00z0
	G91x03z0
	G91x10z0
	G91x35z0
	G91x70z0

Z=0.001 set:

	G91x00z001
	G91x03z001
	G91x10z001
	G91x35z001
	G91x70z001

Z=0.004 set:

	G91x00z004
	G91x03z004
	G91x10z004
	G91x35z004
	G91x70z004

Z=0.01set:

	G91x00z01
	G91x03z01
	G91x10z01
	G91x35z01
	G91x70z01

Z=0.02 set:

	G91x00z02
	G91x03z02
	G91x10z02
	G91x35z02
	G91x70z02

Z=0.03 set:

	G91x00z03
	G91x03z03
	G91x10z03
	G91x35z03
	G91x70z03

	As an example, the set of tables designated G91x00z0 is comprised of 
60 individual tables for variations in enhanced C and O varying between 
zero and 1-X-Z.  Each of these tables have 52 entries in T6 (0.006 to 500) 
and 17 entries in log R (-7 to +1) (although not all grid points are filled).  
G91 refers to the Grevesse 91 mixture described in our papers.  The part 
x00 indicates that there is zero hydrogen content.  The part z0 indicates 
that  the metal content is also zero.  The designations x03, x10, x35, x70 
refer to X=0.03, 0.1, 0.35, and 0.70, respectively.  The designations z001, 
z004, Z01, Z02, and Z03 refer to Z=0.001, 0.004, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03 
respectively.  Tables for X>0 have 50 temperature entries running up to 
T6=100.  Consequently, when X>0 opacity data is restricted by this limit.  
The log R columns  for 0.0, 0.5 and 1.0  only go to T6=0.04 when X> 0.

	The Grevesse 1991 abundances are the best current estimate of solar 
composition.  We have chosen to use it for these abundances the enhanced 
C and O tables simply for lack of a better determination.  Opacity tables 
similar to those currently residing in this directory can readily be 
calculated for other mixtures.  This capability is facilitated by the method 
of corresponding states described in Rogers & Iglesias ,ApJ, Vol 400 (Dec. 
1992)
	The available interpolation codes are
		COTRIN.f
		XCOTRIN.f
                XZTRIN.f

	The code COTRIN.f is intended for interpolation in excess C and O, T6, 
and log R.  It is currently set-up to read the first  file ,i.e., the X=0 file,
from each set of constant Z files.  This requires that the file G91x00z0 (for 
example) be copied into a file named 'codataa'.  Similar calculations are 
possible for X >0, but this requires a recompilation of the COTRIN.f code 
with an altered DATA statement.  See instructions with the code.

	The code XCOTRIN.f is intended for interpolation in X, C, O, T6 and 
Log R for constant Z. To do this for Z=0, for example, requires all five files 
listed under Z=0.  To do the same thing for Z=0.001 requires the five files 
listed under Z=0.001,etc. The interpolation code expects to read the five 
files in each set (from IO unit 2; you may need to change IO unit if there is 
a conflict) from files named codataa, codatab, codatac, codatad, codatae; i.e., 
copy G91x00z0 into a file named codataa, G91x01z into codatab, etc.  The 
same naming  procedure also applies to the other sets at constant Z..  Each 
of the G91x*z* tables requires about 0.02-0.4Mb of memory.  Instructions 
are included with the interpolation codes.  The codes COTRIN.f and 
XCOTRIN.f are identical ,except the parameter mx=1 in COTRIN.f and  5 in 
XCOTRIN.f.

---------------------DESCRIPTION OF POP I TABLES-------------------------

	Earlier we produced tables for the Grevesse 1991 abundances with 
normal C and O for metallicities up to Z=0.04 (ApJS,79, 509,1992).  We 
have now included the effect of spin-orbit interactions and extended the 
tables to Z=0.1.  Physics effects that make some small additional changes 
(a few per cent), beyond those reported in ApJ ,397, 717,1992, have also 
been incorporated.  These tables can be read from the file G91highz.
The code XZTRIN.f is available for interpolation of this file.  It 
is a revised version of XCOTRIN.f.
