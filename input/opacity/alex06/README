The gs98* tables in this directory are from the Ferguson et al. 2005
paper for the Grevesse & Sauval (1998) mixture of heavy elements.  The
notation is in the form mixture.x.z.tron, where

x=mass fraction of hydrogen
z=mass fraction of metals

All of these are concatenated into alex06g98.tab; they are reorganized
into a form recognized by the evolution code in alexmol06gs98.tab.
