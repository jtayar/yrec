C  DIFCOM CALCULATES THE DIFFUSION OF COMPOSITION DUE TO ANGULAR MOMENTUM
C  TRANSPORT.  THIS IS DONE BY TRANSFORMING TO AN EQUALLY SPACED GRID IN
C  RADIUS, SOLVING A DIFFUSION EQUATION, AND TRANSFORMING BACK.
C
C  INPUT VARIABLES:
C  DT : DIFFUSION TIMESTEP(SEC).
C  COD2 : DIFFUSION COEFFICIENTS FOR COMPOSITION TRANSPORT AT THE ORIGINAL
C         MODEL POINTS.
C  ECOD2 : DIFFUSION COEFFICIENTS FOR COMPOSITION TRANSPORT AT THE EQUALLY
C          SPACED GRID POINTS.
C  EM : MASSES OF THE EQUALLY SPACED GRID POINTS(GM).
C     NOTE: FOR CONVECTIVE BOUNDARIES THE MASS OF THE LAST GRID POINT IS
C           THE MASS OF THE ENTIRE CONVECTION ZONE.
C  HCOMP : ARRAY OF MASS FRACTION OF ALL OF THE SPECIES AT THE ORIGINAL
C          MODEL POINTS.
C  HS1 : LOCATION IN MASS(UNLOGGED) OF THE ORIGINAL MODEL POINTS.
C  HS2 : MASSES OF THE ORIGINAL MODEL POINTS(UNLOGGED).
C  HV : RUN OF DIFFUSION VELOCITIES.
C  IBEG,IEND :THE FIRST/LAST UNSTABLE POINTS IN THE REGION.
C     NOTE: FOR CONVECTIVE BOUNDARIES THESE ARE ONLY THE FIRST CONVECTIVE
C           POINTS ADJACENT TO AN UNSTABLE RADIATIVE REGION.
C  IMIN : THE INNERMOST RADIATIVE ZONE OUTSIDE OF ZONE 1.
C  LCZ : FLAG WHICH TELLS WHICH OF THE ORIGINAL MODEL POINTS ARE
C        CONVECTIVE FOR ANGULAR MOMENTUM TRANSPORT PURPOSES(I.E. INCLUDES
C        OVERSHOOT REGIONS). LCZ=T IF CONVECTIVE.
C  LOK : FLAG SET T WHEN FINAL ITERATION IS BEING PERFORMED.
C  M : NUMBER OF MODEL POINTS.

C  OUTPUT VARIABLES:
C  HCOMP IS UPDATED IN DIFCOM TO GIVE THE NEW RUN OF COMPOSITION AFTER
C  ANGULAR MOMENTUM TRANSPORT.
C
C  BEFORE THE LAST ITERATION(LOK=F),ONLY DIFFUSION OF H,HE4,HE3 CALCULATED
C  TO CALCULATE CHANGE IN MU GRADIENTS CAUSED BY DIFFUSION.
C
C  WHEN LOK IS T, ONLY DIFFUSION OF SPECIES HEAVIER THAN HE4 IS PERFORMED
C  (AS DIFFUSION OF LIGHTER SPECIES HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE).
C  THE EQUALLY SPACED GRID POINTS FROM THE LAST UNSTABLE REGION SOLVED
C  ARE USED INITIALLY, AND THEN THE PROGRAM CHECKS FOR ADDITIONAL UNSTABLE
C  REGIONS INTERIOR TO THAT.
